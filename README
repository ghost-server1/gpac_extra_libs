README for GPAC EXTRA LIBS
==========================

GPAC is a multimedia framework oriented towards rich media and distributed
under the LGPL license.

The GPAC EXTRA LIBS package provides you with the external dependencies
required to compile GPAC.

Each official release of GPAC has its corresponding GPAC EXTRA LIBS release
package. You shouldn't use GPAC and GPAC EXTRA LIBS packages which don't hold
the same version number. If you are a developper, you should consider getting
the latest GPAC EXTRA LIBS package from Subversion.

The latest GPAC EXTRA LIBS package can be found within the GPAC Subversion
repository. To retrieve it, please execute:
    svn co https://gpac.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gpac/trunk/gpac_extra_libs/
