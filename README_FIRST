This package contains all libraries needed to build an almost complete complete version of GPAC.
To find out more about non included libraries in this package, please refer to GPAC install documentation.
To unzip all libraries 's source code, run unzip_all.sh

1. For Windows Users:
	- Compiling with MS VC: open build/msvc/BuildAll_vc10.sln, select build target (Win32 or x64) then do Build -> Build solution
	- Get FFMPEG libraries from the web (for example, using zeranoe builds)
	- To copy all libraries and DLLs to GPAC directory: from command line run: CopyLibs2Public.bat [arch] [path_to_gpac_dir]. [arch] should be x86 (for 32 bits) or x64 (for 64 bits).
	
2. For GCC Users:
	- Build PlantinumSDK: cd to PlatinumSDK then run: Build.sh x86-unknown-linux. The libraries are in Build/Targets/x86-unknown-linux/Debug, copy them to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
	- Build OpenSVC: run build_opensvc_static.sh then copy libOpenSVCDec.a in opensvc/svcsvn to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
	- Build OpenHEVC: run build_openhevc_static.sh then copy libLibOpenHevcWrapper.a in openhevc to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
	
3. For iOS Users: 
	- Build SDL: cd to SDL_iOS then run generate_SDL.sh
	- Build FFMPEG for iOS: see README in ffmpeg_ios
	- Build OpenSSL for iOS: see README in OpenSSL-for-iPhone
	-	cd to build/xcode_ios the run generate_extra_libs.sh
	- To copy all libraries to GPAC directory: run CopyLibs2Public4iOS.sh [path_to_gpac_dir]

4. For MacOS Users:
	- Build PlantinumSDK: cd to PlatinumSDK then run: Build.sh universal-apple-macosx. The libraries are in Build/Targets/universal-apple-macosx/Debug, copy them to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
	- Build OpenSVC: run build_opensvc_static.sh osx, then copy libOpenSVCDec.a in opensvc/svcsvn to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc
	- Build OpenHEVC: run build_openhevc_static.sh osx, then copy libLibOpenHevcWrapper.a in openhevc to gpac/extra_lib/lib/gcc

5. For Android Users:
	- cd to build/android/ then run gpac_build_all_extra_libs.sh [path_to_ndk]
	- All libraries are in lib/android, copy those libraries to gpac/extra_lib/lib/android
